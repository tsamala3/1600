# Digital Information/Images

### Bit

The byteLinks to an external site. is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

Examples:

- 32 bits is the same as 4 bytes.
- 8 bytes is the same as 64 bits.
- An image that is 230,400 bytes is 1,843,200 bits.
- A storage device that holds 8,388,608 bits is also said to hold 1,048,576 bytes.
Note: b represents bits and B represents bytes.

## Bandwidth

The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path (such as network or serial cable). It is measured as an amount of data per unit of time. For example, a data rate of 1000 bps is 1000 bits per second and a data rate of 1000 Bps is 1000 bytes per second.

## Prefixes
When we are dealing with large numbers, rather than presenting the number as it is we use prefixes that indicate a multiple or fraction of a unit. You may have heard of megabytes (MB) of memory or gigabytes (GB) of disk storage. The common prefixesLinks to an external site. in computing are: kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, and exa.

The meaning of these prefixes is sometimes different in computing than in general use. For example, kilo generally means a multiplier of 1000. 1 kilo of something would be 1000 of that thing. In computing kilo can mean 1024. 1 kB of memory would be 1 kilobyte of memory which is 1024 bytes of memory. Why 1024 instead of 1000? 1024 is a power of 2: 2^10 (two to the power of ten). Since we represent things in binary, which is base 2, it makes sense for kilo to be a power of 2.

## Digital Images

A numeric representation, normally binary, of a two-dimensional image. Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of vector or raster type. By itself, the term “digital image” usually refers to raster images or bitmapped images (as opposed to vector images).
