# Digital Information


## Bit

The byteLinks to an external site. is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

Examples:

32 bits is the same as 4 bytes.
8 bytes is the same as 64 bits.
An image that is 230,400 bytes is 1,843,200 bits.
A storage device that holds 8,388,608 bits is also said to hold 1,048,576 bytes.
Note: b represents bits and B represents bytes.
