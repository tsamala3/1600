## BinaryArithmetic


The binary number system works similarly to the base 10 decimal system we are used to using, except that it is a base 2 system consisting of only two digits, 1 and 0.[1]

The binary numbers system is the basis of computer functionality.[2] Essentially binary code uses 1s and 0s to turn certain processes off or on. Binary numbers can be added just as decimal numbers, and while the process is familiar, adjusting to the base 2 system can make it a confusing endeavor. It is helpful, then, to have a complete understanding of how place value works in the binary number system before attempting to add binary numbers.

### Binary Addition
[link](https://www.exploringbinary.com/binary-addition/)
To add two multiple-digit decimal numbers, you first need to know how to add two single-digit decimal numbers. This requires the memorization of 100 facts, or 55 facts if you exclude the commutative or “turnaround” facts. Also, because of carries, you need to know ten additional facts: 10 + 0 = 10, 10 + 1 = 11, … , 10 + 9 = 19. The latter apply when there’s a carry (always 1) and the “top” digit is 9.

### Binary subtraction

[Subtraction](https://www.wikihow.com/Subtract-Binary-Numbers)

For decimal [subtraction] (https://www.exploringbinary.com/binary-subtraction/), the basic facts are things like 5 – 1 = 4, 9 – 8 = 1, and 18 – 9 = 9. In each case, the answer is a single-digit, nonnegative integer. Most of the facts are “single-digit minus single-digit” problems, but some are “double-digit minus single-digit” problems (the double digits are the numbers 10 through 18). The latter represent cases of borrowing, which is the process by which negative answers are prevented.
