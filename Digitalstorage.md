## Digital Storage

[Data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage) is the recording (storing) of informatio in a storage medium. DNA and RNA, handwriting, phonographic. recording, magnetic tape, and optical discs. are all examples of storage media. Recording is accomplished by virtually any form of energy. Electronic data storage requires electrical power to store and retrieve data.

# Volatile vs. Non-Volatile


For [volatile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_memory) storageLinks to an external site., if power is switched off or lost any stored data is gone. Random Access Memory (RAM)Links to an external site., the main memory in a computer system, is an example of volatile storage. The computer uses RAM, the volatile storage, as temporary storage while the computer is operating. This is done because RAM is FASTâ€¦presently much faster than non-volatile storage.

For [non-volatile storage](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/15261/non-volatile-storage-nvs), data persists after turning off or losing power. Non-volatile storage is used for long-term storage. Magnetic tapes, hard disks, optical disk, DVD, Blu-Ray, and solid state drives (SSDs) are examples of non-volatile storage. Non-volatile storage tends to be more inexpensive than volatile storage and has slower access and transfer speeds.
